			<h2>•	Issues “Sci.calls” is aiming to resolve</h2>
			<p>“Problem” might be the most commonly used word all around the world. Therefore, we as “Sci.calls” decided to try to get to the roots of this phenomenon. And the best way to do this is to start making changes in education system, as this is where everything stems from. Our project would like to assist students in overcoming the obstacles and even turning them into new opportunities. Our main goal is to create an efficient education system, that enables students to have a strong psychological background as well as firm scholastic base. Our target is to solve great variety of important issues, like high violence rate among schoolchildren, lack of communication skills, generation gap, inability to compete, lack of knowledge to cope with serious life matters, lack of interest in education process and etc. We’re obliged to keep our students away from all these issues and show them the ways of dealing with those problems, in case of facing any.</p>
